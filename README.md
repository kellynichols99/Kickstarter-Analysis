# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project

We have been tasked with analysing historical Kickstarter campaigns to determine the best month to start and relaistic financial goals to set based on successful campiagns in the theater category.

## Analysis and Challenges

We were challanged with the amount a data available from historical campaigns and narrowing that down to what data should be focused on to make the best imformed descision.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

If we were to look into the successful campaigns based on the launch date we see that the months of May and June are highly successful for the theater community.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

If we are just looking into campaigns based on the financial goal set, then we will see that the following ranges have the highest successful rate. Less than $5,000 have been the most successful, as well as the $35,000 to $44,999 range.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
These rates can also change widly based on the campaign location, so it is suggested to also filter out eroneus locations int he decision process. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? 
<b>May and June are the best months to start a campaign, and December is the worst time.</b>

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
<b>Campaign goals under $5,000 are the most sucessful. </b>

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
<b>None found</b>

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
<b> It may be helpful to see how sucessfull campaings have been based on how long they ran for.</b>
