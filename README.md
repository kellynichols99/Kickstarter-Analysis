# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends in fund raising campaigns
<p>
Based on my findings, I was able to determine the best months to hold your campaign, and statisticly suggested financal goals. Historicly campaigns in the United States are more successful when started in the months of May or June. For setting financial goals I found that the average successful campaign was $5,049, suggesting that your goal of $4,000 is statisticly achievable. Please see that attached simplified data.
